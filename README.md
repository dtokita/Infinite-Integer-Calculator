# Infinite Integer Calculator

This calculator was my final project for EE205 (Object-Oriented Programming). It is designed to accept decimal or binary integer inputs and perform various operations on them such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, and factorial.

Another feature is that the output format can be toggled between decimal, binary, and scientific notation. The precision of the scientific notation is also adjustable. A naive GUI as well as a help guide is also included.
